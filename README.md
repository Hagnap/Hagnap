##### About Me
Currently I'm a Data Quality Analyst but I am looking to begin my career in software engineering. I have always enjoyed the creativity and problem solving skills when programming and I **love** being able to  take an idea or a solution and create it via programming. I love software and I love engineering. In my free time I like to code, game with friends, occasionally binge watch Hulu/Netflix, and watch coding related streams/videos. In the past few months I have been learning Web Development, which is something I neglected when getting my degree in Computer Science. This journey has been interesting one as it I have learned I enjoy this much more than I thought I would. It has been a fun learning process, one of my favorite things to do is to use the more *intermediate/advanced* CSS Selectors, it's always satisfying to get them right on the first try. The only thing I really dislike is designing a webpage (I'm not an artist and I'm proud!) so I like to recreate other people's designs. It's a fun challenge and it saves me the work of trying to create a somewhat pleasant webpage design, the most I do is look up color palletes that I like, it's the little things. While on this journey I have begun learning JavaScript... It's a language I have heard many things about (for better and worse) but so far I have been loving it, granted I have yet to do anything with React, Angular, Node, or any other framework or library so I could be ignorant to some quirks. The thing I really about JS is that I can do EVERYTHING with it that I can do with CSS or HTML. Now I still use those languages but just a tad less. Anyways that's enough about me, you can find more info about me on my LinkedIn (link is under profile pic & bio)
