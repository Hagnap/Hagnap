##### About Me
Currently I'm a Data Quality Analyst but I am looking to begin my career in software engineering. I have always enjoyed the creativity and problem solving skills when programming and I **love** being able to  take an idea or a solution and create it via programming. Im currently learning JavaScript in my freetime. If Im not doing that then Im either binging TV shows and/or YouTube videos, gaming, golfing, playing with my dog Jody, or out with friends:)
